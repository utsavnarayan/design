Below learnings are based on 3 iterations of the same product over a course of 4 years:
- Developed the product in Angular 1. Then migrated to Angular 1.5.
- Developed same product in Angular 2. Then migrated half of it to React 16.
- Developed same product from ground up and solely in React.

Here are the learning (not in any specific order):

- Use single framework and stick to It :P
- Always go for out of the box tools and frameworks for reducing dev-work, ensuring standards, less bugs and less maintenance
- Do deep dive to ensure that the libraries/frameworks/tools on which the project will be dependent can be used for near future (2+ years) and - will serve upcoming use cases
- Do regular update of dependencies 
- Insist on a UI common components library which is regularly maintained and updated
- Keep view layer as light weight as possible with minimal/zero state. This will simplify debugging, refactoring, unit-testing and ensure a single design pattern is followed across.
- Keep all business logic in model and controller layer (redux, actions, reducers, mappers, selectors, immer)
- Use strong typing (TypeScript)
- Use linter (Prettier). It will reduce code review comments drastically and will ensure that reviews are for design and logic.
- Do unit-testing, localization, logging/analytics from Day 1
- Simplify UI using static configs
- Keep code modular and separate by folders but in as few (GIT/NPM) packages as possible. Split when required. This will save dev efforts.
- Take code debt and code smell seriously to keep stack maintainable and up to date
- Build project from Day 1 keeping in mind the future deasibility of micro UI architecture.
